title: One Year of Spaced Repetition Learning With Anki
---

I've been using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for the past year. I started
using it after a long time of being frustrated with my poor memory. I finally
started using it after reading Michael Nielsen's [Augmenting Long-term
Memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html). It's a long read, but it's
definitely wroth the time.

I spend about five minutes a day reviewing cards, and my only regret is that I
didn't start using Anki earlier, especially during college.

I started off slowly because I wanted to make using Anki a consistent habit I
could keep up. Every day, I would check [Merriam-Webster's Word of the
Day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day). If I didn't know the word
already, I would add it to Anki. My first card was for the word
["trousseau"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trousseau), which I
added on September 28, 2018. In the year since then, I've added 741 cards.

For the first few months, I only added vocabulary cards. It became a reliable
habit, and being able to recall words felt empowering. I began to add
programming cards as well.

In the past, I've found myself searching for an answer to a programming
question, ending up on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and
realizing that I've visited the page before because I've had the same question
in the past. I just forgot the answer. Now, I will frequently add cards to Anki
whenever I visit a Stack Overflow page.

Nielsen's post, along with other tips I read about using Anki, helped me to
avoid mistakes early on, resulting in my current strategy.

Making good cards is part of the learning process. This is one reason I've never
used pre-made decks. Anki lets you [share
decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/), but I've never used one.

Make cards as atomic as possible.

Account for the different ways that we can retrieve the same information. "What
does term X mean?" is a different question from "What term means Y?" I
frequently make pairs of cards when I care about retrieving the information in
both ways.

This isn't always the case though. For my vocabulary cards, I only
make definition cards. One reason is that many definitions would have multiple
words that fit, so going backwards to a specific word would be difficult. The
other reason is that my primary motivation for building my vocabulary is so that
I don't have to interrupt my reading so often to look up words I don't know. I'm
not interested in using fancy words in my writing, where I try to stick to
plain language as much as possible, so recalling words is not important to
me.
